        Just finished watching this inspirational movie once again and thought I could share some inspirational and educational quotes from the movie. Please enjoy!

        "Ever since we were young, we believed that life was a race. If we didn't run fast enough, we would be trampled and overtaken. Man, even to be born, we had to race 300 million sperm." - Farhan.
        
        
        "A cuckoo bird never makes its own nest. She lays eggs on other birds nests. And when her babies come to the world, what do they do first? They kick out the other eggs from the nest. Competition over. Their life begins with murder. That's nature. Compete. Or die." - Virus.
        
        
        
        "Remember - Life is a race. If you don't run fast enough, someone will overtake you and move faster." - Virus.
        
        
        Machine Class Professor: Why are you back?
        Rancho: Sir, I forgot to take something...
        Machine Class Professor: What?
        Rancho: Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information; that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hardbound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with foreword, introduction, table of contents, index; that are indented for the enlightenment, understanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through sensory route of vision - sometimes touch.
        Machine Class Professor: [confused] What are you trying to say?
        Rancho: Books sir! I forgot to take my books.
        Machine Class Professor: Couldn't you just say that simply?
        Rancho: I tried sometime before, but you didn't like it the simple way, Sir.
        
        
        "There was knowledge everywhere. Go get it from anywhere you can." - Rancho.
        
        
        "Mr. Lobo, my son died falling off of a train on a Sunday afternoon. On Monday morning, Viru Shastrabhuddhe gave a lecture here. So don't tell me that nonsense. I can only give you sympathy. Not an extension." - Virus.
        
        
        Rancho: That day I understood that this heart scares easily. You have to trick it, however big the problem is. Tell your heart, ‘aal izz well, aal izz well.’
        Raju: Does that solve the problem?
        Rancho: No, but you gain courage to face it.
        
        
        Give me some sunshine,
        Give me some rain,
        Give me another chance,
        I wanna grow up once again...
        - Joy Lobo.
        
        
        "Sir! What Number 1, sir? Here we don't talk about new ideas. Or about new inventions! We only talk about getting good grades, or a good job in the USA. We don't gain any knowledge here, Sir. They only teach us how to bring back good grades here." - Rancho.
        
        
        "And this is a college, not a pressure cooker! The lion in a circus learns that he needs to sit on the chair if his owner has a whip in his hand. But that lion is called well-trained, not well-educated." - Rancho.
        
        
        "Never study to be successful, study for self efficiency. Don’t run behind success. Follow behind excellence, success will come all way behind you.” - Rancho.
        
        "We learned something about human behavior that day. If your friend fails, you feel bad. But if your friend comes in first, you feel worse." - Farhan.
        
        
        "Today my respect for that idiot shot up. Most of us went to college just for a degree. No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife, no credit card, no social status. But none of this mattered to him, he was in college for the joy of learning, he never cared if he was first or last." - Farhan.
        
        
        "Who was the first man to step on the moon? Neil Armstrong obviously. We all know that, but who was the second man? Don't waste your time. It's not important. Nobody ever remembers the man who came in second." - Virus.
        
        
        "Do you know why I come first? Why? Because I'm in love with machines. Engineering is my passion!" - Rancho.
        
        
        "Dude, quit engineering and become a wildlife photographer! Do something that you have talent for. If Lata Mangeshkar's (singer) father told her to become a fast bowler. Or if Sachin Tendulkar's (Cricketer) father told him to be a singer. Imagine where they'd be today. Do you understand what I'm saying? Idiot. He loves animals but he's marrying machines!" - Rancho.
        
        
        "Dude, if you fear the future so much, how can you live? And how can you focus on today? I've got strange friends, Man. One of them is living in fear, and the other one is not living at all!" - Rancho.
        
        
        "But you be whatever your heart tells you to. And if he scares you too much. Keep a hand over your heart and say, "AAL IZZ WELL!" - Rancho.
        
        
        "Whatever you enjoy doing, make that your profession. Then work won’t seem to be work, but a game." - Farhan quote Rancho.
        
        
        "If I become a photographer? I'll just earn less, right? My home will be small, my car will be small. But, dad, I will be happy! I will be really happy. Whatever I do, I'll be doing it from my heart." - Farhan.
        
        
        "Sir, I have learnt to stand up on my feet after having broken both my legs. This attitude has come with great difficulty. No sir, I can't. You may keep your job, and let me keep my attitude." - Raju.
        
        
        "Everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job". - Recruiter.
        
        
        "If I pass, it'll be because of my own ability. Otherwise it's okay if I fail." - Raju.
        
        
        "You've got a solid kick. Are you going to be a footballer or what? Become. Become whatever your heart wants." - Virus.
        
        
        "Children, achieve excellence. Because then success will chase you!" - Rancho.
        
        
        
        "Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down. " - Rancho.
